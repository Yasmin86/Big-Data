What is Data?
The quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer,
 which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded 
on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media.

What is Big Data?
Big Data is also data but with a huge size.
 Big Data is a term used to describe a collection of data that is huge in volume and yet growing exponentially with time. 
In short such data is so large and complex that
 none of the traditional data management tools are able to store it or process it efficiently
