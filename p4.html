</ul>Besides the processing capacity and cost issues, designing a big data architecture is another common challenge for users.
 Big data applications must be customized to an organization's specific requirements, 
 a DIY project that allows IT professionals and application developers to put together a range of resources from all the available technologies.
  Deployment and management of large data structures often involve new skills compared to the ones possessed
   by database administrators (DBAs) and developers focused on relational software.
All of these problems can be solved by using a managed cloud service, 
but IT administrators need to keep a close eye on cloud utilization to make sure costs don't get out of control.
 Additionally, transfer of on-site data sets and delivery of workloads to the cloud is also a dynamic process for organizations.
